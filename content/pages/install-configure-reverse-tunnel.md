Install and configure Fogbow Reverse Tunnel
==========

The reverse tunneling service provides public IP access to virtual machines created in the private cloud, even if the local cloud offers only private IPs to these virtual machines. The Fogbow Reverse Tunnel is distributed in two forms: as source code or as a binary package for debian-based distributions. Choose the best distribution for your system, download it and install it as follow

## Install from source
To get the lastest stable version of the component, download it from our repository

``` shell
wget https://github.com/fogbow/fogbow-reverse-tunnel/archive/master.zip
```

Then, decompress it:
``` shell
unzip master.zip
```

Now, install it with Maven:

```
cd fogbow-reverse-tunnel-master
mvn install
```

## Install from debian package

Download a stable version from our <a href="http://downloads.fogbowcloud.org/stable/debian/">package repository</a> and install it with dpkg:

```bash
dpkg -i fogbow-reverse-tunnel_$version.deb
```

## Configure
After the installation, rename the file ```reverse-tunnel.conf.example``` to ```reverse-tunnel.conf``` and edit its contents:
```bash
# Port to run the HTTP service of the Reverse Tunnel.
# The HTTP service handles request to create and get tunneled ports.
http_port=2223

# The reverse tunnel service employs multiple tunnel servers to balance the service load.
# The service allocates one port to each server.
# The tunnel_port_range property defines the range of servers' ports, thus the number of servers.
tunnel_port_range=2224:4224

# Number of ssh ports to be allocated in each server.
ports_per_ssh_server=5

# The range of public tunneled ports.
external_port_range=20000:30000

# Path to ssh key to be generated by the SSH Server.
host_key_path=hostkey.ser

# Expiration time to a tunnel port token
# A token is associated with a created tunneled port.
# The token expires after not been used for idle_token_timeout seconds.
# After expiration, the port is reclaimed and can be used by another request.
idle_token_timeout=86400

# Period interval in seconds to verify token expiration
check_ssh_servers_interval=120
```

## Run
To start the reverse tunnel server, run the start-tunnel-server script inside ```./bin```.
``` shell
./bin/start-tunnel-server
```
