```
Then, install it with Maven
```bash
mvn install
```

## Install from debian package
To set up the reverse tunnel server, first, download to the [latest debian package](http://downloads.fogbowcloud.org/stable/debian/v0.2.1/fogbow-reverse-tunnel/fogbow-reverse-tunnel_v0.2.1.deb)
```bash

After the installation, move the file ```reverse-tunnel.conf.example``` to ```reverse-tunnel.conf``` and edit its contents:

```bash
# Port for SSH tunnels
tunnel_port=2222

# Port for HTTP requests

tunnel_host=0.0.0.0

# Range for external ports
external_port_range=40000:50000
