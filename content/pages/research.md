## Research

There is a great deal of research effort behind the materialization of Fogbow, most of which has been made by the <a href="http://lsd.ufcg.edu.br/" target="_blank">Distributed System Laboratory</a> of the <a href="http://www.ufcg.edu.br/" target="_blank">Federal University of Campina Grande</a>, in Brazil. This has been possible thanks to funding received from many sources, including <a href="http://www.cnpq.br/" target="_blank">CNPq</a>, through the <a href="http://eubrazilcloudconnect.eu/" target="_blank">EUBrazil Cloud Connect project</a>, and <a href="http://www.finep.gov.br/" target="_blank">FINEP</a>, through the CICN project.
